Welcome to Privacy Discussions in Toronto! We are a group of people who aim to increase global awareness and knowledge about privacy and security, starting in our own communities. Our focus is digital privacy, and in particular, making conversation about digital spaces accessible and uncomplicated.

We organize events in Toronto about privacy--check out [our next event](/blog/2017/05/privacy-101-an-open-discussion---16th-of-may-2017/). We also welcome suggestions, contributors, and anyone who wants to get involved or host their own Privacy Discussions.

## Next Event : Privacy 101: An Open Discussion

The first Privacy Discussion will be held the 16th of May 2017 at the 519 Community Center from 6pm to 8pm. We'll combine a brief talk and a workshop, and leave time for a Q&A/extended discussion.
